# Create Traveller DB from scratch

## Create a database to store data about travellers, destinations and trips:

- Travellers have many destinations through holidays
- Destinations have many travellers through holidays
- Trips have one traveller and one destination

## Craft queries to return:

- Number of trips for each traveller
- All destinations visited by a specified traveller
